* FTumbler: Extensible Lists for Filesystems

Tumblers are stable positions for ordering items in lists, which
permit the insertion of new items at any point without renumbering
existing items.

Tumblers are an idea from the mythical Xanadu project:

http://www.udanax.com/green/febe/tumblers.html

This is an implementation of tumblers using strings containing only
the characters 0-9 and a-z, making them usable as file names in
ordinary filesystems.

** The simplest tumblers, using only 0 and 1

We can build the simplest tumblers using only the characters "0" and
"1", and the rule that a tumbler must not end with "0".

To construct a new tumbler between two existing ordered tumblers T1
and T2:

 * (Rule 1) if T1 is the same length as T2: append "1" to T1

 * (Rule 2) if T1 is longer than T2: append "1" to T1

 * (Rule 3) if T1 is shorter than T2: replace T2's final "1" with "01".

*** Proof that we can always find a tumbler between two tumblers

Assume two strings T1 and T2 containing one or more of the characters
"0" and "1", and not ending in "0", with T1 < T2.

If the two strings are the same length or T2 is shorter than T1,
adding "1" to T1 per Rule 1 or 2 will always yield a new string T, so that

 * T is greater than T1 (because T has T1 as prefix but is longer), and
 * T is smaller than T2 (because T1 is smaller than T2, and T has T1
   as unchanged prefix).

If T1 is shorter than T2, replacing the final "1" of T2 with "01" per
Rule 3 will always yield a new string T, so that

 * T is greater than T1 (since T1 is shorter than T2, T2's final "1"
   does not influence comparison to T1, so changing it in T cannot
   make T equal to or smaller than T1), and
 * T is smaller than T2 (because the penultimate "0" in T is smaller
   than the final "1" in T2 it is replacing).

*** Examples

Example 1: T1 and T2 are the same length, so we add "1" to T1 per Rule
1:

 * 01 (T1)
 * 011 (T)
 * 11 (T2)

Example 2: T1 is longer than T2, so we add "1" to T1 per Rule 2:

 * 10101 (T1)
 * 101011 (T)
 * 111 (T2)

Example 3: T1 is shorter than T2, so we replace the final "1" of T2 with
"01" per Rule 3:

 * 1 (T1)
 * 11001 (T)
 * 1101 (T2)
